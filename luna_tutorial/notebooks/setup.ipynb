    "\n",
    "Hello! This tutorial shows you how to set up and tear down your workspace in a Jupyter Lab notebook (or ipython environment) in order to execute tasks from the luna pathology library. Here are the steps we will review:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prerequisites\n",
    "2. Set up your virtual environment\n",
    "3. Clone the repository and install dependencies\n",
    "4. Setup Luna packages and configurations\n",
    "5. References\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine with at least 16GB free memory. This tutorial will not run on a laptop with 16GB total memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed you have a Jupyter lab environment set up for executing these notebooks. If not, you may follow the instruction at https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html to install the lab environment on your host system of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The software prerequisites listed here must be installed on the host system and not through the jupyter lab (or ipython) environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must download Apache Spark to your local computer in the case that it is not already downloaded (https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have the correct version of Java, Scala, Python, and R installed in the correct place on your computer. Apache Spark runs on Java 8/11, Scala 2.12, Python 3.6+ and R 3.5+.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the links for installations of Java, Scala, Python, and R. Again, make sure you download the correct versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Java AdoptOpenJDK: https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html\n",
    "Scala: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/\n",
    "Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "R: https://www.r-project.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to have the path to your Java installation in your JAVA_HOME environment variable. "
